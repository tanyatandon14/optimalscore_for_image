provide optimal score for the image compression so that the quality is not poorly degraded. the quality after compression will be down but it will not be visible to human eyes . 
- created  web application through streamlit in which we will upload the image and the compressorio will return us the image with the optimal score tto which the image can be compressed to without hampering the image quality .
- used python different libraries -numpy ,pandas,scikit learn ,time etc .
- used streamlit for UI PURPOSE 
-  compression of the image for the given % is done through the API - TINYPNG
